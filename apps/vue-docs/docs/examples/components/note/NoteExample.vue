		Pascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and
		seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will
		have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas if God does
		exist, he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in
		Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in Hell).
