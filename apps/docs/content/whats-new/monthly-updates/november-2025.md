## New Features

### [Dial Pad]: Long Keypress on 0 Key to Access +

As part of accessibility testing, it was suggested that adding a long key on the `0` key to allow a user to enter the `+` symbol would improve the [dial pad](/components/dial-pad/) experience. So we added it.

### [New Design Token Architecture]: Beta Docs Released

We have released the first iteration of the docs for our new [Design Token Architecture]()

### [Color Picker, Simple Color Picker]: Signed Off for Accessibility

Our new [Color Picker](/components/color-picker/) and [Simple Color Picker](/components/simple-color-picker/) have both been sign off by for Accessibility by Applause (independent accessibility specialits).
