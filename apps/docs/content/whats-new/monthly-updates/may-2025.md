## Icon: Added label Attribute for Accessible, Informative Icons

The Icon component now supports a []`label` attribute](/components/icon/code/#label) to improve accessibility for [informative (non-decorative) icons](/components/icon/accessibility/#informative-vs-decorative-icons). This provides a reliable way to convey meaning to assistive technologies.

This replaces our previous recommendation to use `aria-label`, which does not consistently work across all screen readers when applied to non-interactive elements like Icon.

## All Components: icon Attribute Deprecated in Favor of icon Slot

The `icon` attribute on all has been deprecated. The recommended way to add an Icon to a component is via the `icon` slot.

Using the `icon` slot allows you to pass in an actual icon element, which can include an accessible `label` â€” making it possible to describe informative icons for screen reader users. This approach provides greater flexibility and improves accessibility.

## Searchable Select: Max Selected Enhancement

When Searchable Select is in multiple mode, it is now possible to set the [maximum amount of items](/components/searchable-select/#max-selected) the user can select.
The amounts (selected and maximum) are displayed to the user next to the label.

## Badge: Adds Size Variant

It is now possible to align the [size of ther Badge component](/components/badge/#size) with size of the smallest Button variant. This is helpful for layouts where they are [aligned together horizontally](/components/badge/use-cases/#usage-with-buttons), eg. inside a Data Grid.

## Card: Clickable Card (Link or Button)

The [Card can now be made clickable](/components/card/code/#clickable-cards) as either a link or button.

## Radio Group: Adds helper-text and error-text Attributes

We have added [`helper-text`](/components/radio-group/#helper-text) and [`error-text`](/components/radio-group/#error-text) attributes to the Radio Group component bringing it inline with other form element.

## Dial Pad: Adds focus Method and autofocus Property

We have add a [`focus` method](/components/dial-pad/code/#methods) and an [`autofocus` property](/components/dial-pad/code/#properties) to the Dailpad component.

## Empty State: icon-decoration is Deprecated

The `icon-decoration` prop is deprecated with the previous `outline` style now becoming the default and only icon styling. `icon-decoration` will be removed from the API in a future major release.

## Menu Item: control-type Replaces role Attribute

As part of our drive to improve accessibility we are decoupling our component API from any `HTML` accessibility attributes. To this end we have [introduced the `control-type` attribute](/components/menu-item/#control-type) to replace the `role` attribute which will be deprecated.
