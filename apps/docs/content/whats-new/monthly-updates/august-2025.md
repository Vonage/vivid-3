# August 2025 - Monthly Update

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new and improved in the Vivid Design System for August 2025.

## Office Hours Meetings

**19/08/2025**: [Watch the recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17jg51cPi5dbMx8EIrHwxONW7s1XV2AO4/view?usp=drive_web)

- [Option]: Discussions highlighted several enhancements for the option component, including support for right-side icons/avatars, multi-line descriptions, additional slots, and clearer selection indicators (checkmarks). The team agreed a more composable, variant-based approach (simple, complex, etc.) would better cover these needs while maintaining backward compatibility.
- [Vivid Live Figma Component Issues]: Design inconsistencies observed in Figma will be tracked in a Google Sheet/Doc instead of JIRA, as the files may change significantly with upcoming token and API updates. One specific gap noted is missing focus states in some components â€” developers are advised to use the focus states available in the dev library.

## v5 Release

Vivid **Version 5** is now live ðŸŽ‰. For more information on what changed and guidance on updating, please refer to the [V5 Migration Guide](/migration-guides/v5-release-migration/).

## Accessibility Testing Results Documented

With only a few components still awaiting accessibility sign-off from Applause, weâ€™ve started publishing test results in the Accessibility section of each componentâ€™s documentation.
Components that have been signed off but include known exceptions now have those exceptions clearly listed in the docs as well.

## Accordion: Adds 'ghost', ghost-light' and 'filled' Appearance Variants

You can now alter the [appearance of Accordion Items](/components/accordion/#appearance). This makes it more flexible was using it on difference background colors.

## Selectable Box: Adds Control Placement

You now have more [control over the placement](/components/selectable-box/#control-placement) of the Checkbox/Radio control.

## Split Button: Adds 'outlined' Appearance

We have added the ['outlined' appearance to Split Button](/components/split-button/#appearance) bringing it inline with the Button component.

## Tag: Adds 'subtle-light' Appearance

We have added the ['subtle-light' appearance to Tag](/components/tags/#appearance) which adds some transparency to the background color.

## Toggletip: Adds Localized Label to the Anchor Element

We have improved the accessibility and flexibility of the `aria-label` added to Toggletip's anchor element. The label is now more descripted and also localized so it supports multiple languages.

## Date Time Picker Moves Out of Alpha Status

After being integrated by product teams and tested for accessibility by Applause, we have moved [Date Time Picker](/components/date-time-picker/) to full release.
