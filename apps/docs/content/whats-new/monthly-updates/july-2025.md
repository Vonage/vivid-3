- Testing: Discussion about breaking changes to A11y selectors.
- [Option]: Support for description (two-line variant).

## Data Grid: Adds fixed columns functionality

We have added the [`fixed-columns` attribute](/components/data-grid/#fixed-columns) to the Data Grid component, which allows you to set a number of columns that remain fixed to the left edge of the grid while scrolling horizontally.

## Date/Range/Time Picker: Accessibility fixes

The Date Picker, Date Range Picker, and Date Time Picker components have been enhanced with several accessibility fixes, including improved contrast for the selected day and a corrected keyboard focus order.

## Divider: Adds appearance attribute

The default Divider color has been updated to match the latest design requirements. You can now also use the [`appearance` attribute](/components/divider/#appearance) to apply alternative styling when needed.

## Menu Item: Adjust component styling to align with the Option

The Menu Item component’s styling has been adjusted to align with the Option component, ensuring visual consistency across the design system.

## Searchable Select: Add label support for Option

Searchable Select now supports displaying a custom label for each option using the [`label` attribute](/components/option/code/#label), just as it was already possible in Select.
