## Date Time Picker Alpha Release

The [Date Time Picker](/components/date-time-picker/) is now in Alpha. It combines an Input and a Calendar/Time Picker popover to allow users to enter or select a date and time.

## Searchable Select: Async Option Loading

It is now possible to load the options for the [Searchable Select component asynchronously](/components/searchable-select/use-cases/#asynchronous-option-loading). This means that the search and filtering can be done server-side.

## Calendar: Sticky Mode

You can now make the calendar's header row, column, or both [sticky](/components/calendar/#sticky-mode), improving the user experience in space-constrained layouts.

## Combobox & Searchable Select: Small UX Enhancement

You can now close the menu on [Combobox](/components/combobox/) and [Searchable Select](/components/searchable-select/) by clicking the chevron icon inside the input.
