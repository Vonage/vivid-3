- [Q4S2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLS-RcACZzkWD-JsmX_rubql1EQWzzHc/view)

## New Features

### [Selectable Box]: Adds CSS Variable For Checked Background Color

For situations when you need to override the current checked background color (like when there are interactive elements inside the box), we have added the `--selectable-box-checked-bg` variable. [See a usage example here](/components/selectable-box/code/#checked-background-color).

### [Searchable Select]: Adds Select / Deselect All Feature

We have add the `enable-select-all` attribute to add a [Select / Deselect All option](/components/searchable-select/#enable-select-all) at the top of the list.

### [Docs]: Start of Vue.js Example Migration

We have started to migrate all our [component code examples to show Vue.js](/components/accordion/#heading) coded examples as well as the current Web component exmaples.

When this is complete we will remove the [Vivid Vue storybook sites](https://vivid.deno.dev/vivid-vue/) as everything will now here in one place.
