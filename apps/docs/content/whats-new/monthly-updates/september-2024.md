## Searchable Select component released to alpha

**Announcing the new [Searchable select](/components/searchable-select) component.**

Searchable Select allows users to select one or multiple items from a list of options. It provides a search input field to filter the options.

## Data-grid: sort icon placement change

The [sort icon in the header](/components/data-grid/#columndefinitions) of data-grid are now aligned closer to the header text.

## FAB: adds condensed size

We have added a [condensed size](/components/fab/#size) to the FAB component.

## Icon: adds warning connotation

We have added a [warning connotation](/components/icon/#connotation) to the Icon component.

## Tabs: adds shadow to tabs list when they scroll

We have added a shadow to the tab list container when the number/size of tab items creates a scroll. Previously, it could be hard to see that there were more items.

## Tab: adds removable feature

Adds a close button to the [tab component](/components/tab/#removable) to enable removable tabs.

## Form components: adds a condensed variation

Adds condensed size to [Text field](/components/text-field/#scale), [Number field](/components/number-field/#scale) and [Select](/components/select/#scale) components.

## Menu: adds position-strategy

When the menu is within a container that has properties such as `transform`, `perspective`, or `container-type`, which modify its containing block, it messes with the default `fixed` position. This can be remedied by setting the `position-strategy` to `absolute`.
