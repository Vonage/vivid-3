- [Menu]: Achoring popup to caret position inside a Text Area.
  - Team agreed to investigate the posibilities of this request.

## [Form Elements]: Add Contextual Help

We have added a [Contextual Help component](/components/contextual-help/) that can be used on [form elements](/components/text-field/#contextual-help) to give additional context for the form label.

## [Simple Color Picker]: New Component

We have added the new [Simple Color Picker component](/components/simple-color-picker) which allow users to pick a color from a predefined pallete.

## [Option]: Adds secondary text and trailing meta slot

We have added the ability to add [secondary text](/components/option/#secondary-text) to give extra context to an option, and also [trailing meta slot](/components/option/code/#trailing-meta-slot) to add content (eg icon or badge) to the trailing end of the Option.

## [Menu]: Adds offset attribute

We have added the [offset attribute](/components/menu/#offset) to the menu component to allow adding a space in `px` between the menu and the trigger element.
