- Option item - Text styling (Amit Sadan) & Horizontal buttons menu (Amit Sadan)
  - Both these request were specific to a Text Editor component
  - It was decided that instead of extending current components, the text editor should be developed separately
  - The approach was agreed to research third party text editors that can be skinned appropriately and the component implemented by Amitâ€™s team and then when the Vivid team have capacity, they will make it into a web component and added to the Vivid library.
