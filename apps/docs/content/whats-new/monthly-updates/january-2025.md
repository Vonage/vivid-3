## Combobox Alignment With Select

Combobox has been updated to align with the feature of the Select component. This involved adding suuport for:

- [Icon attribute](/components/combobox/#icon)
- [Icon slot](/components/combobox/code/#icon-slot)
- [Meta slot](/components/combobox/code/#meta-slot)
- [Shape attribute](/components/combobox/#shape)
- [Scale attribute](/components/combobox/#scale)

## Audio Player Enhancement

We have enhanced [Audio Player](/components/audio-player/) to align more with the native HTML audio player. The thumb on the audio track timeline only appears when either hovered or focussed on.
