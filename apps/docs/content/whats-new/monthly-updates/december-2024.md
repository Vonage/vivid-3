# December 2024 - Monthly Update

## Scrollbar Styles

We have updated our scrollbars styles, in our components and globally (by adding a [class to the root element](/guides/styles/#scrollbar)), so that they are more visually appealling and consistent across browsers.

## File Picker: Custom Internal Error Messages

We have introduced props to override the internal error messages that are generated by file picker. For example when a [selected file size is too big](components/file-picker/#max-file-size) or when a user selects more than the [maximum number of files](/components/file-picker/#max-files).

## Tabs: Adds Tab Layout Attribute

- The [`tabs-layout` attribute](/components/tabs/#tabs-layout) controls the tabs layout. When set to stretch, the tabs will stretch to fill the available space.
