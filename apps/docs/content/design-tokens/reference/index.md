# Token Types (Reference Pages)

Design tokens cover several dimensions of the interface - color, typography, spacing, shape, size, and elevation. Each dimension has its own purpose and its own set of semantic scales. To keep things simple and predictable, each token category is documented on a dedicated page.

## Categories

### Colors

Covers semantic color families, usage guidance for backgrounds, solids, borders, and text, and the full neutral, accent, status, and accent-alt scales.

[Colors](/design-tokens/reference/colors/)

### Typography

Describes the concept of typography as a compound token (font size, line height, weight, and family), explains style roles, and lists all heading, body, caption, input, and code tokens.

[Typography](/design-tokens/reference/typography/)

### Density

Explains how spacing works, how density affects layout feel, and provides the full regular, condensed, and extended scales.

[Density](/design-tokens/reference/density/)

### Radius

Covers shape families (rectangle, pill, circle), when each is appropriate, and the full scale for each radius group.

[Radius](/design-tokens/reference/radius/)

### Size

Details how size tokens help standardize icons, UI elements, and layout blocks, with a reference table for medium and large families.

[Size](/design-tokens/reference/size/)

### Elevation

Explains depth, shadows, and layering, and includes the full elevation scale for regular surfaces.
