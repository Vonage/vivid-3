1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.000
Titles appear under the rippling water
that floods a grungy tile floor:

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.250
"the orange open movie project presents"

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.250
"elephants dream"

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.000
An old man’s face is reflected in the water.

5
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.750
He looks up.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.750
The old man shoves young Emo to the floor of a bridge
as a flurry of thick black cables zips by.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The cables plug themselves into banks of sockets
that line the walls of a steel chasm.

8
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.000
The ever-changing web of cables moves on.

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Dirty and gaunt, Emo considers.

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.500
Balding and stooped with sideburns and a beak-like nose,
the old man, Proog, leads them off the bridge.

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.750
He pulls Emo through a slit in the wall.

12
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.000
They enter a dark, cavernous space
filled with cables transmitting bolts of light.

13
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.500
A suspended path of rectangular panels
crosses the immense room.

14
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
They run along the winding path.

15
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
On the overhead wires, small robotic birds
take notice and begin to fly about.

16
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.500
One of the panels flips when Proog steps on it,
forcing him to run on the underside of the path!

17
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Emo continues along the top with Proog defying gravity beneath him.

18
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
More panels flip, but the pair keeps running
whether right-side up or upside down.

19
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The path abruptly ends and the two men slide to a stop.

20
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Several birds lift off of their wires,
and swoop down on them!

21
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Everything turns black.

22
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.500
A red carpet lies on the floor of a small, dark room.

23
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.000
Above it, a single light shines down on an old-fashioned telephone.

24
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.000
When Emo reaches out to answer it, Proog slaps his hand.

25
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The earpiece is full of carnivorous plants!

26
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The projection of a rotary telephone ticks away like a wall clock.

27
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.500
In the corner, a typewriter robot taps at its keypad.

28
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.000
Proog picks up a sharp walking stick, and leads Emo out of the room.

29
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Emerging from a drainpipe, a small duck-like robot swims through the air.

30
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The two men proceed along a short plank
that extends into a vast, dark space.

31
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Tossing his walking stick...

32
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:21.000
...Proog steps off the plank!
Robotic arms rise up to meet his feet!
The two men cross the void using the robotic arms like intuitive stepping stones.
Proog dances, kicking his legs and waving his arms.

33
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Emo walks calmly behind him.

34
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
An arm whacks the duck-like robot.

35
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Reaching the other side,
they step into a small room
with walls resembling mottled marble.

36
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The doors slide shut, and Proog presses a red button.
The room lurches - they’re inside an elevator capsule!
A giant metal arm hurls the capsule up a massive shaft
past jagged steel doors that shut behind them like mechanical sphincters.

37
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Up above, a robotic bird pecks at a scrap of metal.
The capsule whips by into the grip of another giant arm.

38
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
They’re launched further up the shaft.
The capsule breaks apart leaving Proog and Emo on a fast-moving platform.

39
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Proog watches the walls of the shaft whip by.

40
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The platform rises into a concave land dotted with steel towers.

41
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
They descend down another shaft.

42
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The platform lands on a narrow bridge.
Wires tumble in glass drums beneath their feet,
while movie projectors with legs lumber along beside them.
Proog finds his walking stick, and a door is projected onto the wall.

43
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
He presses a button on his walking stick.

44
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
<v.x-fast>The space changes!</v>

45
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
They stand in a small, tiled room.

46
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Gritting his teeth...

47
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
...Proog slaps him!

48
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
<v.fast>When Emo strides off the room extends to allow it.</v>

49
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Giant metal worms appear!

50
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They break down the walls!

51
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Proog covers his face.

52
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Giant hands rise up behind him!

53
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
He dives to the ground, avoiding their grip.
Emo shrugs, and turns to leave.

54
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Grabbing his walking stick, Proog leaps up, and clubs him over the head!
When Emo collapses, the hands and worms wither and fall.

55
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Kneeling beside Emo’s body, Proog hangs his head.

56
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Emo’s hand lies motionless atop the tangle of lifeless metal worms.
