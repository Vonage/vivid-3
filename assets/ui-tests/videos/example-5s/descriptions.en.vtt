1
00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:08.100
In animation, mist hangs over snow-capped mountains. 
Our view weaves among the craggy peaks.

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.100
Titles appear: "The Blender Foundation presents 
the Durian Open Movie Project."

3
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.100
"A Blender Institute Production. 
This film was supported by The Netherlands Film Fund."

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.467
A figure trudges through the snow, using a long pole to steady her steps. 

5
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.467
The slim teenaged girl leans into the wind, clutching her leather collar close around her neck. 

6
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.467
A bandit attacks! 
The girl blocks his spear with her pole. It breaks in half!

7
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.400
The bandit swipes at the petite girl with the spear. 
She dodges his blows.

8
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.400
Trapped against a boulder, she draws her dagger from its sheath and stabs his shoulder!

9
00:00:57.167 --> 00:01:01.000
He flings her aside and draws his own dagger.

10
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.700
She scoots backwards, grabs the bandit's fallen spear, and plunges it into his belly!

11
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
The bandit falls heavily onto his side and lies still. 

12
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.200
The girl, Sintel, rolls onto her back, her chest heaving.
Wind ruffles her short, shaggy red hair. 

13
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.500 
She narrows her golden-brown eyes. 
A short distance away, a warm light glows from a yurt.

14
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Sintel retrieves the spear and drags it behind her as she staggers across the arctic terrain.

15
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.000
An emblem of a tree appears next to a title: "Sintel."

16
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The girl's labored steps grow slower and she collapses.

17
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.333
Inside the yurt, a shaman studies the spear.

18
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.833
He ladles hot soup into a bowl.

19
00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:04.133
He hands her the bowl.

20
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.433
Bright embers from the fire float up into the air.

21
00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:39.600
In a flashback, Sintel searches through debris in a medieval city.

22
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.000
Waving away pesky flies, she picks through fruit found under a pile of boards. 

23
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.700
Something crashes onto a nearby roof!

24
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.700
Sintel scrambles up onto the roof and draws her dagger.

25
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400
A frightened baby dragon cowers.

26
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:9.200
The size of a cat, the scaly dragon widens its golden eyes. 
Two little horns curve down around its head. 

27
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.200
Blood oozes from a wound on one of its leathery bat-like wings.

28
00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:22.467
Sintel cautiously holds out her hand and the dragon sniffs her fingers. 

29
00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:28.467
Later, in her hovel, Sintel cleans the wound.

30
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.867
With a smile, Sintel cradles the little creature. 

31
00:03:40:00 --> 00:03:45:00
Later, she sets down a bowl of water and smoothes a garment into a cozy nest. 

32
00:03:46:00 --> 00:03:50:00
The dragon crawls into the nest and lies down. 
In her bed, Sintel pulls a cover up to her chin.

33
00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:54.533
Time passes. The little dragon, Scales, sleeps near Sintel's bed.

34
00:03:54.533 --> 00:04:07.000
Sintel's fingers curve gently around the dragon's tiny talons. 
A scar from the wound forms a jagged pattern on its left wing.

35
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.500
A chicken runs down an alley.

36
00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:16.067
The dragon chases the chicken! It flies over a cart. 
Sintel follows, running past startled city dwellers. 

37
00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:25.067
She barrels into a crate of fruit, spilling it. 
Sintel stops and looks around.

38
00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:34.200
The chicken falls at Sintel's feet! 
As she stares at it, Scales perches on a beam overhead. 

39
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.500
The little dragon exhales a small fiery cloud. 
Blinking her golden-brown eyes, Sintel smiles. 

40
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000 
In the sky, a dozen birds fly by in a V-formation. 
Scales casts a longing gaze at them.

41
00:04:44.500 - 00:04:54.500
The dragon takes flight, following the birds. 
Sintel sprints up an old stone staircase to the top of a ruin.

42
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
On the roof, she watches Scales cavorting in the air with the birds. She grins.
