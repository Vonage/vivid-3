# Note

`vwc-note` component is designated to layout connotated notification content.

```js
<script type="module">
  import '@vonage/vivid/note';
</script>
```

```html preview
<vwc-note connotation="success" icon="check-circle" headline="Pascal's theological argument">
 Pascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas if God does exist, he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in Hell).
