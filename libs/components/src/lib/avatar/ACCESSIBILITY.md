## Implementation

- **Label interactive avatars**
  - Always provide an aria-label when the avatar is a link (href) or a button (clickable).
  - Use clear, descriptive text (e.g. "Profile avatar", "User profile picture").
- **Label icons in slots**
  - When using the icon slot, always provide a label property.
  - See the [Icon component guidelines](/components/icon/accessibility/#informative-vs-decorative-icons) for details.
- **Mark decorative avatars as presentation**
  - If the avatar is purely decorative and not interactive, use `role="presentation"` so itâ€™s ignored by assistive technologies.
