## Implementation

- Use the **status** attribute for the status title so it is exposed to assistive technologies.
- Place the description in the default slot; keep it concise.
- If you provide a custom icon via the **icon** slot, give it an accessible label or make it decorative with `aria-hidden="true"` when the status text already conveys the status.
