## Implementation

Use the `timeoutms` attribute with care. Users with disabilities may need more time to read the content. If the Alert contains interactive elements, such as links or buttons, you should avoid using `timeoutms`. See also [WCAG SC 2.2.3 No Timing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/no-timing).
