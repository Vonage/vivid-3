## Implementation

### Icon Only Fab

Use the `aria-label` attribute to provide alternative text for _icon-only_ Fab. This text is read by screen readers and lets the user know the purpose of the Fab.

## Best Practices

### Avoid Disabling Buttons

Disabled Fab don't explain why the Fab isn't usable, and they aren't focusable at all for people using keyboard navigation.

Instead, keep the Fab pressable, and use validation and errors to explain what needs to be done to proceed.
