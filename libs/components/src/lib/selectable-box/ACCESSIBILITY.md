## Implementation

- When used as a collection of Selectable Boxes make sure the parent container element has a `role` of `group`.
- If there is no text content inside the Selectable Box (as in the [image based boxes use case](/selectable-box/use-cases/#image-based-boxes)) make sure the Selectable Box has an `aria-label` to give it an accessible name.
