## Implementation

- Badges are informational only and must not be interactive.
- If you need an interactive element, use a [Tag](/components/tag/) instead.

### Icon-Only Badges

- For badges that contain only an icon, always set the [Iconâ€™s label attribute](/components/icon/code/#label).
- The label provides alternative text for screen readers, describing the purpose of the badge.
