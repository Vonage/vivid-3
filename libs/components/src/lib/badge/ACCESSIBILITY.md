## Implementation

Badges are informative elements and cannot be interacted with.  
If you're looking for an intractable component, consider using a [tag](/components/tag/) instead.

### Icon-only Badge

Use the `aria-label` attribute to provide alternative text for icon-only badge. This text is read by screen readers and lets the user know the purpose of the badge.
