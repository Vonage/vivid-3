## Implementation

- **Icons**: ideally the icon should be accompanied by a label or text, but if this is not the case, be sure to supply the **Nav Item** or the **Nav Disclosure** component with an aria-label attribute so that screen reader user will know the purpose of the items.

## Keyboard Interaction

When the nav has focus:

`Enter`: activates the nav-disclosure and toggles the visibility of the content.  
`Space`: activates the nav-disclosure and toggles the visibility of the content.  
`Tab`: moves focus to the next element in the tab order.  
`Shift` + `Tab`: moves focus to the previous element in the tab order.
