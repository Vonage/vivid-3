## Implementation

The slider has a `role` of `slider`, which needs an accessible label. You must provide it using `aria-label`.

Vivid automatically sets the `aria-valuetext` attribute on the slider. The attribute is read by assistive technology. You can control its format using the `valueTextFormatter` property for a more human-readable value.
