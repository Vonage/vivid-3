## Implementation

- **Icons:** ideally the [icon should be accompanied by a label](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/), but if this is not the case, be sure to supply the **Tab** component with an `aria-label` attribute so that screen reader user will know the purpose of the tab.

## Best Practice

- **Write short, descriptive tab labels**. Tab labels should usually be 1-2 words. Short labels are more scannable; if you need longer labels, itâ€™s a sign that the choices are too complicated for tabs and maybe an [Accordion](/components/accordion/) is a better choice.
- **Avoid tab list scrolling**. Make sure there is enough horizontal space to encorporate the amount of tabs you are presenting.
