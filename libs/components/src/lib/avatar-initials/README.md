#### longer text
- If more than 2 words - only the 2 words avatar-initials will appear.

```html preview
<vwc-avatar-initials text="john doe vivid avatar"></vwc-avatar-initials>
```

#### one word
- Should present one letter if only one word (not working yet...)

```html preview
<vwc-avatar-initials text="avatar"></vwc-avatar-initials>
```

#### no text inserted
- if no text is added - no initials are set.  
- What about the title? Is it OK to leave it empty?
