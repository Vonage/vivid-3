# Partials

Partial components are reusable building blocks that can be used **as standalone widgets** or inside [table](/components/table/) cells (and other layouts). They keep a consistent look and behavior wherever they appear.

## Status

The [Status](/components/status/) component shows a status icon and a description. Use it on its own (e.g. in cards or lists) or inside a table cell to show status in a row.

## Country

The [Country](/components/country/) component shows a country flag and country code. Use it as a standalone widget (e.g. in profile or contact views) or inside a table cell to show country in a row.
