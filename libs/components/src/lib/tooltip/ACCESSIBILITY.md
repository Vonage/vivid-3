## Implementation

### Anchor Element Accessbility

The anchor element must be focusable (eg a Button) as this interaction is integral for the Tooltip's functionalilty.

## Best Practices

### Use Only If Absolutely Necessary

If the information is important enough for a Tooltip, isn't it important enough to always be visible?

### Location, Location, Location

Where you put your Tooltip is key. It is important that Tooltips are clearly visible, but they should not obscure other important website information or elements.

### Write Crystal Clear Content

Ensure that the words inside the tooltips are clear – no fancy jargon, no long-winded sentences. Just straight-up, plain-language explanations. If a tooltip makes you scratch your head, it’s not doing its job.
