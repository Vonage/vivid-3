```

## Usage

Import components in your project:

```js
import '@vonage/vivid/button';
```

And include in HTML:

```html
<vwc-button label="Click me"></vwc-button>
```

For a full list of components, explore the [components docs](https://vivid.deno.dev/components/accordion/) ðŸ“š.

### Prerequisites

The Vivid components library rely on a set of **core styles** to:

- Be present in the DOM

- Be shared across all components

- Apply common design identities (such as colors, typography, spacing etc')

- Ensure the components look as intended.

As the task of loading css is not trivial, and may vary from project to project, this library does not provide any way to load the css. It is up to the author to load the css in the most appropriate manner for their project.

To **include the styles**, css files must be loaded into the project from the `node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles` folder.

The folder contains the following files:

- Fonts

  - `fonts/spezia.css` - Loads the *Spezia* variable font and specifies its font face definition. *Spezia* is Vonage's branded font and is required by most Vivid components

- Themes - only one theme can apply at a time. thus, only one is required to be loaded

  - `themes/light.css` - Light theme

  - `themes/dark.css` - Dark theme

Note: scss users can simply [forward](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward) the styles to their scss project:

```css
@forward 'node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/fonts/spezia';
@forward 'node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/themes/light';
```
