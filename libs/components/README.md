## Installation

To integrate Vivid components into your project, run:

```bash
npm install @vonage/vivid # or yarn add @vonage/vivid
```

## Usage

Import components in your project via [side effect imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#import_a_module_for_its_side_effects_only):

```js
import '@vonage/vivid/button';
```

And include in HTML:

```html
<vwc-button label="Click me"></vwc-button>
```

For a full list of components and API, explore the [components docs](https://vivid.deno.dev/components/accordion/) ðŸ“š.

### Tokens (Prerequisite)

The Vivid components library rely on a set of **design tokens** (in the form of css custom properties).

Tokens should not affect the look of the application rather just provide a common set of identities (such as colors, typography, spacing etc') to be used by the components to look as intended.

As the task of loading css is not trivial, and may vary from project to project, this library does not provide any way to load the css. It is up to the author to load the css in the most appropriate manner for their project.

To **include the styles**, css files must be loaded into the project from the `node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/tokens` folder and require a `vivid-root` class selector to be present on the wrapping element (commonly `body`).

Folder contains the following files:

- `theme-light.css` - Light theme

- `theme-dark.css` - Dark theme

Only one theme is required to be loaded.

### Fonts (Prerequisite)

- `node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/fonts/spezia.css` - Loads the *Spezia* variable font and defines its font face values. *Spezia* is Vonage's branded font and is required by most Vivid components. folder also contains the font files.

### Styles (Optional)

In Addition to the tokens and fonts, the components library also provides a set of styles that can be used to align the application with the Vivid design system.

These styles are not required by vivid components directly but rely on the tokens and fonts ðŸ‘† to be loaded.

- `node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/core/theme.css` - Sets theme related styles

- `node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/core/typography.css` - Sets typography related styles

- `node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/core/all.css` - Set all the above styles

Note: scss users can simply [forward](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward) the styles to their scss project:

```css
@forward 'node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/[path to file].css';
```

## Built With

- [Fast](https://www.fast.design) - to extend element classes and compile code to native web components
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - for ergonomic and type-safe code
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - for styles authoring extensibility and consistency

## Quickstart

Global content delivery networks can help quickly integrate content within html pages, fetching content from an URL, skipping local builds entirely.
Such practice is often used when working on POCs or reproduction environments.
Tools like [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com), [jsDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com), [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev) etc' are bound to deliver any content registered in the npm registry.

The following snippet fully renders a Vivid button component

<!-- import light theme style tokens -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@vonage/vivid@next/styles/themes/light.css">

<!-- import typography for desktop -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@vonage/vivid@next/styles/typography/desktop.css">

<!-- import Vivid button component -->
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@vonage/vivid@next/button/index.js"></script>

<vwc-button label="Click me" appearance="filled" connotation="cta"></vwc-button>
