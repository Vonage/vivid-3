## Installation

To integrate Vivid components into your project, run:

```bash
npm install @vonage/vivid # or yarn add @vonage/vivid
```

## Usage

Import components in your project via [side effect imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#import_a_module_for_its_side_effects_only):

```js
import '@vonage/vivid/button';
```

And include in HTML:

```html
<vwc-button label="Click me"></vwc-button>
```

For a full list of components and API, explore the [components docs](https://vivid.deno.dev/components/accordion/) ðŸ“š.

### Prerequisites

The Vivid components library rely on a set of **core styles** to:

- Be present in the DOM

- Be shared across all components

- Apply common design identities (such as colors, typography, spacing etc')

- Ensure the components look as intended.

As the task of loading css is not trivial, and may vary from project to project, this library does not provide any way to load the css. It is up to the author to load the css in the most appropriate manner for their project.

To **include the styles**, css files must be loaded into the project from the `node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles` folder.

The folder contains the following files:

- Fonts

  - `fonts/spezia.css` - Loads the *Spezia* variable font and specifies its font face definition. *Spezia* is Vonage's branded font and is required by most Vivid components

- Themes - only one theme can apply at a time. thus, only one is required to be loaded

  - `themes/light.css` - Light theme

  - `themes/dark.css` - Dark theme

Note: scss users can simply [forward](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward) the styles to their scss project:

```css
@forward 'node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/fonts/spezia';
@forward 'node_modules/@vonage/vivid/styles/themes/light';
```

## Built With

- [Fast](https://www.fast.design) - to extend element classes and compile code to native web components
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - for ergonomic and type-safe code
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - for styles authoring extensibility and consistency

## Quickstart

Global content delivery networks can help quickly integrate content within html pages, fetching content from an URL, skipping local builds entirely.
Such practice is often used when working on POCs or reproduction environments.
Tools like [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com), [jsDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com), [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev) etc' are bound to deliver any content registered in the npm registry.

The following example fully renderes Vivid button component

```html preview
<!-- import spezia font -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@vonage/vivid@next/styles/fonts/spezia.css">

<!-- import light theme style tokens -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@vonage/vivid@next/styles/themes/light.css">

<!-- import Vivid button component -->
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@vonage/vivid@next/button/index.js"></script>

<vwc-button label="Click me" appearance="filled" connotation="cta"></vwc-button>
```
