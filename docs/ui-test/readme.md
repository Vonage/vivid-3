# Visual Tests Documentation

Vivid's visual tests consist of two parts:

1. Automated snippets extraction from our documentation (visual regression)
2. Functional tests inside each component

Vivid's visual tests run on chrome, firefox and webkit (Safari).

## Tests consistency

In order to maintain the tests' consistency and reduce flakiness, the tests are dockerized. Running the tests inside a container makes sure tests don't fail for small Operating System differences like fonts and pixel interpretations.

Our docker image runs the tests on the 3 browser on the Linux OS.

## Writing the tests

Each component folder should contain a `ui.test.ts` file.
The file must be updated with the `componentName` and snapshot path `'./snapshots/componentName.png'`.
PRO TIP: utilizing the _component_ generator (`npx nx g @vonage/nx-vivid:component my-component`) will populate basic `ui.test.ts` to get you up and running with ui-tests.

## Running the tests

### Local

Running the tests can be done locally by running:

`npx http-server -p 8080 -s & npx playwright test -c ./libs/components/playwright.config.ts`

This will start the tests locally with the local playwright and browsers versions.

**Note:** that this might result in flaky tests because of versions mismatch

**Note:** that this will result in failed tests in the first run because the snapshots for your setup do not exist

**Note:** do not push new snapshots. There are only 3 snapshots used for CI purposes - and these are the checked out linux snapshots in each component.

### Dev/Watch Mode

You can also run the tests locally in watch mode:
`npx nx run components:e2e:watch`

This will spin up the dev server and watch for changes in the code to restart the tests.

A useful scenario would be to develop a single component:

1. Start the tests using `npx nx run components:e2e:watch`
2. Set up your component's to be the only test to run: `test => test.only`
3. Add `await page.pause();` inside the test case.

### Why Docker?

In order to avoid flakiness, we've set up a docker image to run the tests. This requires docker installed on your machine. [Click here to learn how to install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

After you have docker installed, run:

`npx nx run components:e2e`

If you wish to update the visual snapshots (i.e. you've changed the design and want it to reflect in the saved snapshots) run:

`npx nx run components:e2e --update-snapshots`

All arguments are passed to playwright, so if you want to update a single component's snapshots, run:

`npx nx run components:e2e --update-snapshots button`

### Running the docs tests

The visual tests for the documentation are run separately from the components. They are run the same way as the components, but with a different command: `npx nx run docs:e2e`. The config file is located in `./apps/docs/playwright.config.ts`.

## Updating the docker image

The docker image comes with the browsers and playwright ready for action. If, for some reason, there's a need to update the playwright version, a new version should be published to the docker hub. To understand how to build multi-platform images (needed to run on Mac/intel and Mac/ARM), [you can read this page](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/). Here's a summary of commands:

1. Login to docker hub if you aren't already (`docker login`).
2. If you don't already have a `docker-container`-based builder, you'll need to create one and activate it by [following the instructions from this page](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#getting-started). (This is a one-time thing.)
3. As the image you'll build is multi-platform, [it can't reside locally](https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/166#issuecomment-544827163). This means you'll build, tag and push the image in a single command. From the `dockerfile` location, use `./scripts/visual-tests/build.image.sh mybuilder 2.x.x push` using the builder created in step 2 and a new version number.
4. Update the relevant `yml` files that are using this image to use the new version.

## Updating playwright version

1. Change the version in package.json
2. Change the version in the dockerfile
3. Install locally: npm i && npx playwright install
4. Rebuild the image and push it to the repository following the steps described above.
5. Run the tests: `npx nx run components:e2e` to ensure everything works fine
6. Update `.github\workflows\_visual-regression.yml` to reference the new version.

## Checking the tests

All tests must pass. The results of failed tests can be found in the `test-results` folder directly under the project's root folder. Inside you will find a folder per failed test, each with 3 files: `actual.png`, `expected.png` and `diff.png`.
