# Fonts and Tokens

---

Vivid uses **Montserrat** and **Roboto Mono** Google fonts.

**Vonage** products should use the brand-specific **Spezia** font families.

To use the **Spezia** webfont kit in your project, import the following file:

```js
'node_modules/@vonage/styles/fonts/spezia-variable.css';
```
