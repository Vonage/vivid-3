Nothing to discuss

## Combobox: Fixed Dropdown Positioning

The [Combobox](/components/combobox/#fixed-dropdown) component now supports fixed dropdown positioning (as apposed to the standard absolute positioning). This is useful for caases when the dropdown is obstructed by other elements. For example, when the combobox is inside a small dialog.

## Button: New Ghost light Appearance

The [Button](/components/button/#appearance) component has a new `ghost-light` appearance. This introduces opacity to the background color in a hover state.

## New Locale: German (de-DE)

We have add a [new locale](/guides/localization/#supported-locales) to our set of supported locales. German is now supported in all components.

## FAB: Announcement Connotation

The [FAB](/components/fab/#connotation) component now supports the new announcement connotation.
