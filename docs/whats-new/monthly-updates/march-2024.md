# March 2024 - Monthly Update

## New Vivid "Office Hours" Meeting

We are introducing a regular meeting (every 2 weeks) where you, the consumers of the design system, can connect with the Vivid team to ask questions, raise or discuss feature requests, share concerns or just chat and connect.

We have an [agenda document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0yvyGUzBoQFH5l_W6ElBoZaxqZ3HWmDLDqOl0lc8a0/edit?usp=sharing) where we encourage you to add topics / questions that you'd like to raise in the meeting. By doing this, everybody gets a view of what will be discussed and it also gives the Vivid team a little time to prepare prior to the meeting.

Topics will be discussed at a high level and timeboxed to 5 - 10 mins. The aim of this meeting is not to always resolve every query, but to kick off further, more detailed discussions with interested parties.

Attendance is not mandatory. You don't have to ask question to attend, it's fine to just listen in and observe. Also, feel free to dip in and out of the meeting, we don't want to take up any more of your time than necessary.

The first meeting is scheduled for **Tuesday 16th April at 2pm GMT**. Meetings will be recorded and shared in this monthly update section of the Vivid docs.

## Video Player & Range Slider Components Alpha Release

The [Video Player](/components/video-player/) and [Range Slider](/components/range-slider/) components are now in Alpha. If you need to use one of these components, please let the Vivid team know so that we can arrange acceptance testing before moving them out of alpha to fully released status.

## Meta Item CTA Connotation

We have added a [**CTA** connotation to the Menu Item](/components/menu-item/#connotation) component.

## Feature Roadmap

We have added a [Road map](/whats-new/roadmap/) page to the Vivid docs. The page gives you an overview of the larger features that the Vivid team are working on, which stage of our process they are currently in and an approximate expected date of completion.

When a phase is complete, the icon in the table will link to the relavant deliverable for that phase. For example:

- **Discovery** links to the **Proposal document** in confluence
- **Design** links to **Figma design file**
- **Alpha** links to **Component document** in the Vivid docs

## Accessibility Section

We have added a section to our Vivid docs site around [accessibility](/accessibility/overview/). It outlines why accessibility is important, covers how we test for accessibility in the Vivid team and gives some tips on how and what you need to be testing in your app.
