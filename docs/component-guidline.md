# Documentation Conventions

For better and unify components documentation

## Template Guide

Use the new component generator to create a new component:  
`npm run nx g @vonage/nx-vivid:component my-component`

### CSS Class Names

- Use `.base` for the first element in the component.
- Use `.control` for the main form control such as input, buttons etc.'.
- Use kebab case.
- Our template is encapsulated, no need for the component name in the nested elements class-name (like `card-header`).

## Property Names

- `heading` for the head or main text in the component.
- `sub-heading`
- `text`
- `label`

### Slot Names

Use kebab case for slots name.

- `graphic` - for slots that are recommended for decorative element such as custom icon or image
- `media` - for slot that are recommended to contain either images or video.
- `meta`
- `footer / actions`
- `action-ites / action-items` - ?
- `content`
- `App-content` - Maybe change it to `app-main` for slots in components that categorized as templating components (such as side-drawer, top-app-bar).
