## Foundations of the Design System
The core guidelines are driven by the ‘Vonage Brand Toolkit’ and are the foundations on which we built our design system. Specifically, these elements are the subatomic elements of all our components.

### Core Variables
Our core variables are represented as design tokens which are design decisions based on our brand’s design foundations. These include color palette, typography and elevation scale, schemes, platform scale, iconography, etc.

### Atomic Design
Atomic design is methodology for creating design systems. There are five distinct levels:
 - **Atoms** - the basic building blocks of the design system, such as a button or checkbox.
 - **Molecules** - atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a component.
 - **Organisms** - molecules joined together to form a relatively complex section of an interface.
 - **Templates** - consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.
 - **Pages** - are specific instances of templates.

Keeping this philosophy in mind, but wanting to be more practical, we reduce the original levels of Atomic Design to two:

 - **Atomic components** - include atoms and molecules.
 - **Composite components** - include organisms and some templates.

Most Templates and Pages will be built and design by the product design teams based on vivid components.

### Components
Vivid Components are interactive building blocks that implement Vonages design system.  
VVC (vivid-components) are used for creating user interfaces and include a built-in system for connotations, states, and user interactions.

#### Web components
Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.  
  
Vivid Web Components (VWC) are a collection of Web Components maintained by Vivid team.
